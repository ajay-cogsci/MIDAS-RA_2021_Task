Problem - Encounted the following error
"ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 15 fields in line 19219, saw 23" while reading CSV file of dataset
Solution - add argument(error_bad_lines=False) in read_csv() command
Personal Comments - I realized that Line 19219 is a bad line for some reason.  One instance is less likely to cause accuracy fluctuations in such a big dataset.

Problem - The remove_subcategory() does successfully remove the sub-categories from the product_category_tree however fails to stop when there are no categories to be removed and keeps adding the last category to the remaining n_category columns in the DataFrame
Solution - Tried 12 different iterations and definitions of the function. Still can't resolve it.
Personal Comments - 

	1. I know there must exist a small function that deals with removing duplicated entries within the same row but I cant seem to find it in any documentation
	2. While the purpose of the task is resolved i.e the sub-categories have been removed and the last category obviously not going to be the primary category, little harm is done overall. However, I do wish this issue could be resolved.
